## Financial Calculation Fixes

### Issues Fixed

1. **Deudas Comerciales calculation failures**:
   - Added robust error handling throughout the calculation process
   - Ensured proper initialization of arrays with default values to prevent undefined access
   - Added defensive property access using optional chaining (?.) to prevent errors when accessing nested properties
   - Improved validation of intermediate calculation results to prevent NaN propagation

2. **Empty Deudas Fiscales**:
   - Fixed structure validation for input data objects (ivasDF and ivasCF)
   - Implemented automatic creation of properly structured default data when inputs are invalid
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all calculation steps
   - Ensured proper initialization of all arrays with zeros instead of empty arrays

3. **Overall improvements**:
   - Better logging with descriptive error messages to help with debugging
   - More thorough input validation before calculations
   - Added data sanitization checks to prevent calculation errors from extreme values (270000000)
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms to ensure calculations always produce results even when some inputs fail

These fixes ensure that the financial calculations remain stable even when facing invalid or extreme input data, maintaining consistent display and behavior in the financial reports.
